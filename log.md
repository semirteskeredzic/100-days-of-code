# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on FreeCodeCamp, currently on JS Basics.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have gone through this part some years ago I felt I needed a rerun if I want to cope with future challenges. Basics are quite simple and there's no trouble though.

### Day 2: February 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS Basics on FCC, operators, if and switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Still going through the area I am quite familiar with, case statements are quite handy although I have never remembered to use them. Stopped at the neat little challenge to write a blackjack counting code, looking forward to solve it tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS Basics on FCC, Objects with Properties, Nested Objects and Arrays, While, For, Do..While loops and several challenges.

**Thoughts:** Pretty straightforward lessons on arrays, objects, and properties along with various loops. Did couple of challenges though, they required some thought. Firstly, counting cards, then album collection and finally profile lookup. Good days with 2+ hours of code.

### Day 4: February 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS Basics on FCC, challenges - generating random whole or float numbers

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's enthusiasm was followed with a not very enthusiastic day. Perhaps the concepts of random float and whole numbers and all that fuss are easier to grasp, however I found it quite difficult to wrap my head around them. Just made the hour of code, tommorrow will be better.

### Day 5: February 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS Basics on FCC, started ES6 track, challenges with JS Basics & intro to ES6

**Thoughts:** This was an OK day. First there were parseInt functions and then ternary operators, and writing inline functions. After that, I started the ES6 part, I've also done most of the challenges before, but it's needless to say that the current on job php demand really made me more or less forget some of the concepts there. Firstly there were some other notions of declaring variables by using let and const and then using arrow functions. The hardest challenge was the use of rest operator. All in all not bad, looking forward to the day 6.

### Day 6: February 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Track on FCC, Usage of Destructuring assignments

**Thoughts:** Here's monday and another day kicks in. Did several challenges all about the usage of destructuring assignments. Firstly I didn't quite get it, but after few forum posts and step by step insight (accompanied with the careful reading of the task) I've got it all. Good day.

### Day 7: February 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Track on FCC, Template literals, declarative functions, class sytnax with constructors

**Thoughts:** Continuing with ES6, it's template literals and declarative functions, quite straightforward. The class syntax and the constructors are quite similar to php OOP with declaration of classes and constructors (even abstract classes).

### Day 8: February 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Track on FCC, Getters and Setters, Import and Require

**Thoughts:** I have finalized ES6 track. Getters and setters were quite simple to grasp perhaps because I went through them in php oop.
