# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on FreeCodeCamp, currently on JS Basics.

**Thoughts:** Even though I have gone through this part some years ago I felt I needed a rerun if I want to cope with future challenges. Basics are quite simple and there's no trouble though.
